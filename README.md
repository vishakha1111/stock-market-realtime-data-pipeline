# stock-market-realtime-data-pipeline
This project implements an end-to-end real-time stock market data processing pipeline using Kafka and AWS cloud services. The system simulates live stock market events, streams them through Kafka, stores the data in an AWS data lake, and enables serverless analytics using Athena.
